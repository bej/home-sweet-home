Do you know where your rental is going? 
This is a small pet project to sketch a Java based full stack web application in a scenario around accounting and cashflow.

## Why does it exist?
I need a playground to play around with 
- Spring Boot and several other great Spring components like Spring Security, Spring Data Rest, Spring RestDocs
- Angular
- Swagger and Swagger-Codegen

in order to
- have some showcase wo explain _things_ in spontaneous discussions
- have a setup to try out _things_ outside of real projects with deadlines, restrictions, and _reasons_.
