Do you know where your rental is going? 
This is a small pet project to sketch a Java based full stack web application in a scenario around accounting and cashflow.

## Why does it exist?
I need a playground to play around with 
- Spring Boot and several other great Spring components like Spring Security, Spring Data Rest, Spring RestDocs
- Angular
- Swagger and Swagger-Codegen

in order to
- have some showcase to explain _things_ in spontaneous discussions
- have a setup to try out _things_ outside of real projects with deadlines, restrictions, and _reasons_.

## Scenario
Every month you pay the rent for your flat. But where is this money going? Yeah, sure the landlord get's the biggest piece, but there is also heating, water, cleaning, repairs, and many other little things being paid.
So the idea is, to build up a network of accounts to visualize the cashflow of all the incomes and expenses...
